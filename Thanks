The following persons and institutions helped in the development of
APE at one stage or another.

  Many users gave important feed-back with their encouragements,
  comments, or bug reports (and often all three at the same time):
  thanks to all of you!

  Kurt Hornik, of the R Core Team, helped in several occasions to
  fix some problems and bugs.

  Financial support was provided in the early development of APE by
  the French "Programme inter-EPST Bioinformatique" (2001-2003).
